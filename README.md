In this project, we have created an alternative solution for drug authentication and made an analysis of disease breakdown. The techniques and procedures followed to verify the drug, as well as an analysis of disease breakdown, are explained further:

Current drug verification techniques used in India:

Presently, there is no standard method for verifying whether a drug is genuine or not. Only the erasable ink ( T 200 (black) ink series ) is used for printing the expiration date and batch number. There is a huge danger that the printed details can be erased and reprinted for the benefit of business people. At last, the consumer is the one who is affected. To overcome this, we have introduced the verification of drugs using dynamic QR codes.

For this project, we have used the Cofsil drug to verify its authenticity. The drug strip that is used for this project is displayed below:
