# Drug-verification-and-disease-breakdown-analysis

In this project, we have created an alternative solution for drug authentication and made an analysis of disease breakdown. The techniques and procedures followed to verify the drug, as well as an analysis of disease breakdown, are explained further:

Current drug verification techniques used in India:

Presently, there is no standard method for verifying whether a drug is genuine or not. Only the erasable ink ( T 200 (black) ink series ) is used for printing the expiration date and batch number. There is a huge danger that the printed details can be erased and reprinted for the benefit of business people. At last, the consumer is the one who is affected. To overcome this, we have introduced the verification of drugs using dynamic QR codes.

For this project, we have used the Cofsil drug to verify its authenticity. The drug strip that is used for this project is displayed below:

We have created a dynamic QR code for tracking the scanning activities of the user. The QR code contains all the information about the drug, like the

* Medical drug description

* Ingredients used in the drug, uses

* How to use (the procedure for using the drug or equipment)

* Safety information, YouTube

* Like how to use

* Expiration date

* Batch number

* Verification website link

* Toll-free number

* Verification code

* Manufacture details

* Email

* How to use the verification code

The above-mentioned details are written inside the pdf, and further authentication of the medical will be done once after entering the verification website that is given inside the pdf. The sample pdf format is given below:

This dynamic QR code will be printed on the drug strip, When the user wants to verify the drug, the QR code has to be scanned. After scanning the QR code, a PDF will be automatically downloaded, and all the information mentioned above will be shown. A drug strip after applying the QR code looks like this:
